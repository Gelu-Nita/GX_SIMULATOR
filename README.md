# GX_SIMULATOR
GX_Simulator is an interactive IDL widget application intended to provide a flexible tool that allows the user to generate spatially resolved radio and/or X-ray spectra. The object-based architecture of this application provides full interaction with local 3D magnetic field extrapolation models that may be embedded in a global coronal model. By the use of various mouse tools provided, the user is allowed to explore the magnetic connectivity of the model by generating magnetic field lines originating in user-specified volume voxels. Such lines may be selected to create magnetic flux tubes, which are further populated with user-defined analytical thermal/non thermal particle distribution models. By default, the application integrates IDL callable DLL and Shared libraries containing fast GS emission codes developed in FORTRAN and C++ based on the newly developed Fleishmanâ€“Kuznetsov approximation, and IDL X-ray codes developed by Eduard Kontar. However, the interactive interface allows interchanging these default libraries with any user-defined IDL or external callable codes designed to solve the radiation transfer equation in the same or other wavelength ranges of interest.
